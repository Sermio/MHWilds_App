Normal Ammo and arrows will melt if you try to pierce their molten carapaces, so you must use heat-resistant equipment or hit them with Watermoss to bring down their temperature first. Continuous friction will cause their body temperature to rise, but soften their outer shells.",

Flooding them with continuous elemental attacks will eventually overload the organs, forcing the monster out of its enhanced state.",

Destroying the ore stuck to their forelimbs will leave them wide open to attack. They roam a wide area, so environmental elements like falling boulders or Flashflies will be useful in taking them down.

As for the flashes, destroying its crest will stop them; in the meantime, it's a good idea to take cover. If you can't see its crest glow before the attack, that means you're still inside the dazzling danger results.",

You'll need to watch out for those tail claws, but handle an attack well to turn it into a counterstrike opportunity. Destroying the membrane on their necks will lower their guard while aloft.

Not only does this widen the appendage's attack range, but it also increases the monster's charging capacity - so make a point of breaking these parts. Their heads may also be vulnerable after a discharge attack. Hunters are advised to bring thunder-resistant armor and water-based weaponry.",

They have no eyes, but their other senses are develeped and they excel at catching prey off guard, especially with their ability to enter small crevices and crawl quickly across the ground.
